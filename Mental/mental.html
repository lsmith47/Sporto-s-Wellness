                <h3>Wellness</h3>
                <p>Practicing good wellness, along with physical health, allows you to thrive in life rather than just survive. Using wellness skills, we are able to 
                    control how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Through practicing good mental health coping skills, you are able to be more 
                    creative, try and learn new things, and make healthy choices.
