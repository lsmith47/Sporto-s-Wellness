                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>Sporoto&#39;s wellness was designed with the intent of bettering yourself through wellness and self care. More than just your average activity tracker, 
                    Sporto&#39;s Wellness goes beyond to create a healthy lifestyle. Through subsections, this app offers a variety of healthy recipes, mental check-ins, and 
                    full body workouts. Depending on how you are feeling for the day, can determine how you would like to use Sporto&#39;s Wellness. We understand how hard it 
                    is to stick to a “fitness plan,” with Sporto&#39;s Wellness, it&#39;s not a matter of sticking to a plan, but rather doing what&#39;s best for you and your personal 
                    health. Our goal through Sporto&#39;s Wellness is to create a healthy space to encourage and be supportive to hold people accountable for those working to be 
                    better themselves. At the end of the day, people should feel confident and happy with themselves.
